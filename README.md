# ML Quickstart Notebooks

A collection of beginner-friendly Jupyter notebooks to quickly get started with Python, data analysis, and machine learning.  
The notebooks are organized to gradually build from **Python basics** to **core libraries** and then into **machine learning projects**.

## How to Run
- All notebooks have been tested in **Google Colab** (recommended for easy setup).  
- They can also be run locally with **Python 3.8+**.  
- Main dependencies: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow` (see notebooks for exact imports).

## Topics Covered
This collection provides a **complete introduction to the basics of machine learning**:
- Python essentials for data science  
- Core libraries: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn  
- Classic ML projects (classification, regression, computer vision)  
- Hands-on exercises to practice each concept  

---

## Audience
These notebooks are designed for:
- Beginners in Python and machine learning  
- Students or self-learners who prefer **practical, example-based learning**  
- Anyone who wants a quick, structured roadmap from basics to ML projects
