# Framework for Approaching Machine Learning Projects

Machine learning is a big field. In the news, it often sounds like magic.  
This guide gives a clear picture of two things:  
1. The main kinds of problems machine learning can be used for.  
2. A simple way to start small machine learning projects.  

Many people also wonder about the difference between machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and data science.  
The truth is, there are no exact answers. Even people who work in the field for years often find it hard to explain. So if someone says they have the perfect definition, itâ€™s good to be careful.  

For this guide, machine learning is kept simple:  

> *It means using data to find patterns, understand things better, or make guesses about the future.*  

The steps that follow are practical. They focus on building something, testing it, and learning from the results. The best way to understand machine learning is by **doing it**.
