        "- What is broadcasting?\n",
        "    - Broadcasting is a feature of NumPy which performs an operation across multiple dimensions of data without replicating the data. This saves time and space. For example, if you have a 3x3 array (A) and want to add a 1x3 array (B), NumPy will add the row of (B) to every row of (A).\n",

        "    1. If the two arrays differ in their number of dimensions, the shape of the one with fewer dimensions is padded with ones on its leading (left) side.\n",
        "    2. If the shape of the two arrays does not match in any dimension, the array with shape equal to 1 in that dimension is stretched to match the other shape.\n",
        "    3. If in any dimension the sizes disagree and neither is equal to 1, an error is raised.\n",
